# Comparison of Algorithms for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This repository contains a **group project** focused on the comparative analysis of selected heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms applied to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The full project report included in this repository is written in **Polish**.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to compare the performance of several algorithms for solving TSP, based on both solution quality and computational efficiency. The algorithms were tested on datasets with 48, 76, and 127 nodes.

### Algorithms used:
- **Nearest Neighbor (NN)**
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
- **Tabu Search (TS)**
- **Multi-Start Hill Climbing**
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**
- **Excel Solver (benchmark)**

Each algorithm was tested using different parameter configurations, and results were evaluated using multiple performance indicators (e.g., route length, execution time, convergence stability).
